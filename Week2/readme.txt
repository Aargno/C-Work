The program shown in uniAccount.c is meant to take an entered UoB Username
and password from the user, entered in the form (username password) and
validate both. The program will inform the user which if either of the entered
details are invalid or valid.

One function typeReq is a bit longer than I would like, but this is solely due
to the fact that I couldn't get certain aspects of it to work correctly when I
split it into separate functions.

If the program is run with no arguments provided it will run a series of tests
to ensure the program functions correctly.
