My extra program for this submission is triangle details. It is an extension
of the base triangle program done for coursework this week. It currently has all
of the functionality of the triangle program, while also taking the details on
any valid triangle entered and giving some extra information such as the
area of the triangle, and the angles opposite to each side given.

I am currently stuck on trying to implement a function that will give the centre
of mass of any triangle given to it. The two primary things that I am stuck on
are:
-I am having difficulty properly finding a way to find the centre of mass of
a scalene triangle.
-I also am struggling to find a way to display the centre of mass relative to the
data I have, although I could solve this by assuming the first integer entered
by the user is the triangles base.

There are also two functions that are only used in the centre of mass function
and as such are currently unused, these being the two bubble sort functions in
my program.

If I solve these problems before the deadline, this readme will be amended.

Also, when provided with large measurements for sides with minor differences in
lengths, the program will not be able to find each angle accurately, and so
the angles will usually be the same as those found on an equilateral triangle.
